# Python 2 Compatibility note

As of redis-py-cluster 3.0.0 and above, python 2.7.x will not be supported or maintained.

This library follows the announced change from our upstream package redis-py. Due to this,
we will follow the same python 2.7 deprecation timeline as stated in there.

redis-py-cluster 2.1.x will be the last major version release that supports Python 2.7.
The 2.1.x line will continue to get bug fixes and security patches that
support Python 2 until August 1, 2020. redis-py-cluster 3.0.x will be the next major
version and will require Python 3.5+.


# Supported redis-server versions

This lib only tests for and aims to support redis-server 5.0 and above.

In release 3.0.0 redis-server 3.0.x, 3.2.x and 4.0.x was dropped as officially supported redis-server versions.
