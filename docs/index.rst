Welcome to redis-py-cluster's documentation!
============================================

This project is a port of `redis-rb-cluster` by antirez, with alot of added functionality. The original source can be found at https://github.com/antirez/redis-rb-cluster.


The source code is `available on github`_.

.. _available on github: http://github.com/grokzen/pykwalify



Installation
------------

Latest stable release from pypi

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install redis-py-cluster

or from source code

.. code-block:: bash

    $ python setup.py install



Usage example
-------------

Small sample script that shows how to get started with RedisCluster. It can also be found in the file `exmaples/basic.py`

.. code-block:: python

    >>> from rediscluster import StrictRedisCluster

    >>> # Requires at least one node for cluster discovery. Multiple nodes is recommended.
    >>> startup_nodes = [{"host": "127.0.0.1", "port": "7000"}]

    >>> # Note: decode_responses behaves differently with python3 and python2
    >>> rc = StrictRedisCluster(startup_nodes=startup_nodes, decode_responses=True)

    >>> rc.set("foo", "bar")
    True
    >>> print(rc.get("foo"))
    'bar'

.. note:: Python 3

    Since Python 3 changed to Unicode strings from Python 2's ASCII, the return type of *most* commands will be binary strings, unless the class is instantiated with the option ``decode_responses=True``. In this case, the responses will be Python strings (Unicode). Even if ``decode_responses`` is false, the cluster methods ``cluster_nodes`` and ``cluster_slots`` will return a decoded python string.

Dependencies & supported python versions
----------------------------------------

- Python: redis >= `2.10.2`, <= `2.10.5` is required.
  Older versions in the `2.10.x` series can work but using the latest one is allways recommended.
- Optional Python: hiredis >= `0.2.0`. Older versions might work but is not tested.
- A working Redis cluster based on version >= `3.0.0` is required. Only `3.0.x` releases is supported.



Supported python versions
-------------------------

- 2.7.x
- 3.3.x
- 3.4.1+
- 3.5.x

Experimental:

- Up to 3.6.0a0


.. note:: Python 3.4.0

    A segfault was found when running `redis-py` in python `3.4.0` that was introduced into the codebase in python `3.4.0`. Because of this both `redis-py` and `redis-py-cluster` will not work when running with `3.4.0`. This lib has decided to block the lib from execution on `3.4.0` and you will get a exception when trying to import the code. The only solution is to use python `3.4.1` or some other higher minor version in the `3.4` series.



Regarding duplicate pypi and python naming
------------------------------------------

It has been found that the python module name that is used in this library (rediscluster) is already shared with a similar but older project.

This lib will not change the naming of the module to something else to prevent collisions between the libs.

My reasoning for this is the following

 - Changing the namespace is a major task and probably should only be done in a complete rewrite of the lib, or if the lib had plans for a version 2.0.0 where this kind of backwards incompatibility could be introduced.
 - This project is more up to date, the last merged PR in the other project was 3 years ago.
 - This project is aimed for implement support for the cluster support in 3.0+, the other lib do not have that right now, but they implement almost the same cluster solution as the 3.0+ but in much more in the client side.
 - The 2 libs is not compatible to be run at the same time even if the name would not collide. It is not recommended to run both in the same python interpreter.

An issue has been raised in each repository to have tracking of the problem.
